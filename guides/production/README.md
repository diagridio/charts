# Production Tuning

Guidance for self-hosted Catalyst deployments handling real traffic. Pair this
with the tracked overlay
[`values-production.yaml`](../../charts/catalyst/values-production.yaml):

```bash
helm install catalyst ./catalyst \
  -f values-production.yaml \
  -f my-environment.yaml \
  --set join_token="${JOIN_TOKEN}"
```

The defaults in [`values.yaml`](../../charts/catalyst/values.yaml) are
deliberately conservative for evaluation. The recommendations below are the
starting point we suggest for production deployments before tuning further
for your workload.

## At a glance

| Component | Default | Production overlay | Why |
|-----------|---------|--------------------|-----|
| `agent.logLevel` | `info` | `error` | Cut log volume |
| `agent.resources.limits` | `memory: 1200Mi` | dropped | Avoid OOMKill / GC throttling |
| `agent.config.sidecar.log_level` | unset | `error` | Cut sidecar log volume |
| `agent.config.sidecar.autoscaling.enabled` | `false` | `true` (min 2 / max 10) | Real traffic needs headroom |
| `agent.config.sidecar.resources.limits` | `cpu: 1, memory: 512Mi` | dropped | Same as agent |
| `agent.config.internal_dapr.scheduler_resources.limits` | `memory: 175Mi` | dropped | OOMKill under job fanout |
| `management.logLevel` | `info` | `error` | Cut log volume |
| `management.autoscaling.enabled` | `false` | `true` | Match real load |
| `management.resources.limits` | `memory: 1200Mi` | dropped | Same as agent |
| `gateway.envoy.autoscaling` | `1–5 / 80%` | `3–10 / 70%` | Data-plane hot path |

## Managed infrastructure

The recommended path for production is to run Catalyst on managed
infrastructure rather than self-hosting the supporting services in-cluster.
The cloud providers' managed offerings give you backups, point-in-time
recovery, HA, and security patching out of the box — none of which the
in-cluster shortcuts in our examples provide.

- **Managed Kubernetes** — EKS, GKE, or AKS. The chart's
  [Cluster Requirements](../../charts/catalyst/README.md#cluster-requirements)
  section lists prerequisites; any current managed offering meets them.
- **Managed PostgreSQL** — Amazon RDS, Cloud SQL, or Azure Database for
  PostgreSQL. Catalyst uses PostgreSQL for workflow state. The overlay
  already defaults the chart to external PostgreSQL
  (`default_managed_state_store_type: postgresql-shared-external`,
  `external_postgresql.enabled: true`,
  `external_postgresql.auth_type: connectionString`) — you only need to
  supply the connection details from your environment values.

  Use a Kubernetes secret rather than inline plaintext credentials. Create
  a secret with keys `host`, `port`, `username`, `password` (and optionally
  `proxy_host`), then reference it:

  ```yaml
  agent:
    config:
      project:
        external_postgresql:
          existing_secret_name: catalyst-postgres
          existing_secret_namespace: catalyst
  ```

  AWS Aurora users can switch `auth_type: awsiam` and configure
  `aws_auth.*` instead of password-based credentials.

  Running PostgreSQL inside the same cluster as Catalyst is fine for
  evaluation but is not a posture we recommend for production. See the
  **Workflows** section of the
  [chart README](../../charts/catalyst/README.md) for the full schema.
- **Managed object storage / Kafka / Redis** — when used as Dapr
  components, prefer the cloud-managed offerings over self-hosted
  StatefulSets.

The values overlay is agnostic to which managed offering you pick; the
hosts, credentials, and TLS settings belong in your own per-environment
values file alongside `values-production.yaml`.

## Why drop Kubernetes `limits`

For Go services, Kubernetes resource `limits` interact badly with the GC under
production load:

- A **memory `limit`** that's reached triggers OOMKill, dropping the pod
  mid-request. Go's GC will free memory eventually, but cgroup enforcement is
  immediate. Under bursty load the OOMKill window arrives before GC does.
- A **CPU `limit`** that throttles a Go process slows the GC itself, which
  *increases* memory pressure, which makes the OOMKill more likely. The two
  knobs combine into a feedback loop.
- `requests` are still set, so the scheduler places pods on nodes that can
  fit them. Dropping `limits` only removes the cgroup ceiling.

The chart auto-derives `GOMEMLIMIT` from `*.resources.limits` (see
[`templates/_helpers.tpl`](../../charts/catalyst/templates/_helpers.tpl) ::
`catalyst.GetGoLangGOMEMLIMITFromResourceLimits`). When you drop `limits`,
`GOMEMLIMIT` is no longer emitted — that's intentional. If you want a soft
GC ceiling without a hard cgroup limit, set `*.goSoftLimit.override` to an
explicit byte value.

This applies to every Go component: `agent`, `management`, the per-AppID
sidecar, and the per-project Dapr scheduler.

## Sidecar autoscaling

The chart's defaults:

- `replicas: 1`
- `autoscaling.enabled: false`

That's fine for evaluation. For production:

- **`min_replicas: 2`** — keeps capacity headroom across rolling updates and
  voluntary node drains. A single replica means a one-pod restart drops 100%
  of capacity.
- **`max_replicas: 10`** — generous headroom; HPA only scales up if CPU
  exceeds the target. Raise for high-throughput apps.
- **`target_cpu_utilization_percentage: 80`** — leaves CPU headroom for
  bursts without flapping. Lower (60–70%) for stricter latency SLOs.

A min=max configuration disables HPA in practice (the controller has nowhere
to scale to). If you need a fixed pod count for a specific app, leave
`autoscaling.enabled: false` and set `replicas` directly — but understand
that's a non-production posture.

## Dapr scheduler

The per-project Dapr scheduler manages reminder/job state. Its memory grows
with the number of pending jobs, so the chart's default ceiling
(`scheduler_resources.limits.memory: 175Mi`) becomes the binding constraint
under load — when crossed, the pod is OOMKilled and the entire project's
scheduling pipeline restarts.

The overlay drops the limit and bumps the request to `256Mi`.

## Log verbosity

Production deployments should run with `error`-level logs:

- `agent.logLevel: error` — agent itself.
- `management.logLevel: error` — management service.
- `agent.config.sidecar.log_level: error` — per-AppID sidecars.

The volume difference vs `info` is large enough to dominate cluster logging
costs at scale. Bump back to `info` or `debug` via `helm upgrade` when
investigating incidents — log level is not a runtime knob, so plan for the
restart that comes with the upgrade.

## Gateway / Envoy

Envoy sits on the data-plane hot path; under-provisioned Envoy is felt as
end-to-end latency on every request through Catalyst. Defaults
(`minReplicas: 1, maxReplicas: 5, target: 80%`) are fine for evaluation.

For production, the overlay sets `3–10 replicas` with a `70%` CPU target —
three replicas tolerate a node failure without dropping below two; lowering
the CPU target to 70% trades a little headroom for tighter p99 latency.

## PodDisruptionBudgets

The chart does not ship `PodDisruptionBudget` resources for the control-plane
components. For production, define a PDB for each component the overlay puts
behind an HPA so that voluntary node drains (cluster upgrades, autoscaler
events) cannot reduce capacity below a safe threshold.

Example — apply alongside the chart in the same release namespace:

```yaml
apiVersion: policy/v1
kind: PodDisruptionBudget
metadata:
  name: catalyst-management
spec:
  minAvailable: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app.kubernetes.io/name: catalyst
      app.kubernetes.io/component: management
---
apiVersion: policy/v1
kind: PodDisruptionBudget
metadata:
  name: catalyst-gateway-envoy
spec:
  minAvailable: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app.kubernetes.io/name: catalyst
      app.kubernetes.io/component: gateway-envoy
```

Use `minAvailable` rather than `maxUnavailable` so the PDB stays correct as
the HPA scales the workload up. Pick a value below the HPA's `minReplicas`
(e.g. `minReplicas: 3` → `minAvailable: 2`) so a single pod can always be
evicted.

The agent itself runs as a single replica today, so a PDB is not useful for
it — drains will recreate it on a new node.

## securityContext hardening

The chart already sets sensible pod- and container-level defaults on every
control-plane component (see [`values.yaml`](../../charts/catalyst/values.yaml)):

- `runAsNonRoot: true`
- `seccompProfile.type: RuntimeDefault`
- `allowPrivilegeEscalation: false`
- `capabilities.drop: [ALL]`

Two further knobs are commented out in the defaults and worth enabling for
production once you have verified the workload tolerates them:

```yaml
agent:
  securityContext:
    readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
management:
  securityContext:
    readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
```

Verify with a smoke deploy before rolling broadly — `readOnlyRootFilesystem`
will surface any code path that writes outside an explicit `emptyDir` mount.
The init containers and identity-injector already run with
`readOnlyRootFilesystem: true` by default.

## NetworkPolicy

The chart provisions default-deny `NetworkPolicy` resources for every
project namespace, with a curated egress block list (RFC1918 + 169.254
link-local) and an allow-list mechanism for explicit destinations. This is
on by default and well-suited for production — see the **Network Policies**
section of the [chart README](../../charts/catalyst/README.md) for the
allow/deny model and how to extend it. Note that enforcement requires a CNI
that supports `NetworkPolicy` (Calico, Cilium, Azure NPM, AWS VPC CNI with
`ENABLE_NETWORK_POLICY=true`, or kube-router).

## Deployment-specific values not in the overlay

These are environment-specific and belong in your own values file, not the
public overlay:

- **PostgreSQL connection details** — host, credentials, TLS. See
  [Managed infrastructure](#managed-infrastructure) above.
- **Image registries** — `global.image.registry` and the various
  per-component `image_registry` knobs. See the AWS Marketplace overlay
  ([`values-aws-marketplace.yaml`](../../charts/catalyst/values-aws-marketplace.yaml))
  for a registry-mirroring example.
- **NATS endpoints, Sentry trust anchors** — region-specific.
- **Secrets provider** — `global.secrets.provider`. See the Secrets section
  of the chart README.

## Verifying the overlay

```bash
helm lint charts/charts/catalyst/ -f charts/charts/catalyst/values-production.yaml

helm template catalyst charts/charts/catalyst/ \
  -f charts/charts/catalyst/values-production.yaml \
  > /tmp/prod-render.yaml
```

Spot-checks on the rendered output:

- No `resources.limits` block on the `agent` or `management` Deployments.
- No `GOMEMLIMIT` env var on the `agent` or `management` containers.
- Management HPA present with `minReplicas: 2`, `maxReplicas: 5`.
- Gateway/Envoy HPA present with `minReplicas: 3`, `maxReplicas: 10`,
  `targetCPUUtilizationPercentage: 70`.
